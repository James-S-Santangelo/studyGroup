# Plotting with ggplot2

## Introduction

`ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex
plots from data frames. The name `ggplot2` comes from its inspiration, the
book "A grammar of graphics", and the main goal is to allow coders to express
their desired outcome on a high level instead of telling the computer every
detail about what will happen. For example, you would say "color my data by
species" instead of "go through this data frame and plot any observations of
species1 in blue, any observations of species2 in red, and so on". Thanks to
this functional way of interfaces with data, only minimal changes are required
if the underlying data change or to change the type of plot. This helps in
thinking about the data and creating publication quality plots with minimal
amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

`ggplot2` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements, or layers.
Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and
customization of plots. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


## The `diamonds` dataset

We will be working with the `diamonds` dataset in this lesson. This is a large (~54,000 x 10)
dataset containing measurements and prices of various diamonds. If you have an older
computer and would like to just work with a subset of the data, you can create that
subsetted data frame as follows:
  
```{r}
d <- head(diamonds, n = 1000)
```

This will create a new data frame `d` containing just the first 1000 rows
of the dataset.

## Plotting with `ggplot2` - the geoms

### Making our first scatter plot

To build a ggplot, we need to:
  
1. Use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using the
`data` argument

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)

```

If the arguments are provided in the right order then the
names of the arguments can be omitted (as with `dplyr`)

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds)
```

2. Define aesthetics (`aes`), by selecting the variables to be plotted and the
variables to define the presentation such as plotting size, shape color, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

3. Add `geoms` -- geometrical objects as a graphical representation of the data
in the plot (points, lines, bars). `ggplot2` offers many different geoms; we
will use a few common ones today, including:
* `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
* `geom_line()` for trend lines, time-series, etc.
* `geom_histogram()` for histograms

To add a geom to the plot, use the `+` operator. Because we have two continuous
variables, let's use `geom_point()` first:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
geom_point()
```

The `+` in the `ggplot2` package is particularly useful because it allows you
to modify existing `ggplot` objects. This means you can easily set up plot
"templates" and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above
plot can also be generated with code like this:

```{r, first-ggplot-with-plus}
# assign plot to a variable
diamonds_plot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))

# draw the plot
diamonds_plot + geom_point()
```

Notes:

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers
that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x and
y axis you set up in `aes()`.
- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the
aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing
a layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added in the line before the other layer,
`ggplot2` will not add the new layer and R will return an error message.


### Building plots iteratively + scatter plots

Building plots with `ggplot2` is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay the axes, and choose a geom:
  
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (`alpha`) to reduce overplotting:
  
  
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

From the eye test, we can see some evidence of clusters in this scatter plots.
It's possible that one of the categorical variables we have in the data could
explain this pattern. Coloring the data points according to a categorical
variable is an easy way to assess if there seems to be correlation. Let's try
this with `cut`.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

While some clustering is visible here, the pattern is not especially clear.
Perhaps something else in our dataset might be a better predictor. Let's try
`clarity` instead:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

Turns out clarity appears to be a strong predictor here after all.  Given that
IF1 is the best possible clarity measurement, we see that even 1-2 carat IF1
diamonds fetch equivalent prices to 4-5 carat I1 (lowest clarity) diamonds.

### Combining `dplyr` and `ggplot` - line plots

What if we wanted to see how average carat varies by price?
We'd first have to calculate what the mean carat value is for each price
before plotting. Fortunately for us, we can bring back some of those `dplyr`
skills from our previous lesson to do just that.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(price) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat))
```

This transformed dataset can be piped right into a `ggplot` call, with which
we can proceed to plot:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(price) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = mean_carat)) +
  geom_line()
```

There's definitely a lot going on here -- let's just focus on the price range 0 - 5000:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(price) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat)) %>% 
  filter(price < 5000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = mean_carat)) +
  geom_line()
```


### Histograms

Similarly to how we've made line plots and scatter plots so far, histograms in `ggplot2`
can simply be tacked on as another geom. The difference is that histograms do not
take in a y aesthetic, since that'll be 'count' by definition:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The binning of a given histogram can be modified by either specifying a binwidth or a fixed number of bins:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05)
```

### Bar plots with `dplyr` and `ggplot` - using grouped `summarise` operations

Earlier, we saw that the `clarity` variable seemed to be associated with the carat of a given diamond.
Let's investigate this further by calculating the mean carat for each value of `clarity`.
This can be done using a grouped `summarise` operation via `dplyr`:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(clarity) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat),
            sd_carat = sd(carat))
```

Let's pipe this into a ggplot call with `geom_bar`. We have to be careful to specify `stat = 'identity'` as an
argument to `geom_bar`. This is because `geom_bar` will otherwise try to apply some sort of transformation instead
of trying to plot single values, like the ones we have above.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(clarity) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat),
            sd_carat = sd(carat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = clarity, y = mean_carat)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

We also calculated the standard deviation above using `sd()` within `summarise`. This can
be used to generate an errorbar with `geom_errorbar()`:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(clarity) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_carat = mean(carat),
    sd_carat = sd(carat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = clarity, y = mean_carat)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_carat - sd_carat, 
                    ymax = mean_carat + sd_carat))
```

### Boxplots

Although the above plot is in line with the pattern we observed in the scatter plot at the start of the lesson,
we may want to go a step further and visualize the distribution of `carat` for each value of `clarity` with a boxplot.
These are rather straightforward to make:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = clarity, y = carat)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Model fits with `geom_smooth`

Fitting models to data is a common means of investigating whether certain relationships are at play in a given dataset.
`ggplot2` makes visualizing these easy by largely consolidating line-fitting into a single geom - `geom_smooth`.

By default, `geom_smooth` will automatically select what it thinks is the best model for your dataset. However, rarely
will it select a linear fit. To draw a linear fit, we have to specify it:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Adding the color aesthetic we had previously will cause lines to be fit to each individual group:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

To still fit a line across the entire dataset, specify the color aesthetic _within_ `geom_point`, and not globally.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = clarity), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```



## Intermediate `ggplot` 

### Customizing plot appearance

Although our plots have been rendering just fine so far, we may want to go a step further and personalize the plots
in some way. Fortunately, `ggplot2` features a whole host of customization options, all nestled within a handy function
called `theme`. Within `theme`, we can specify certain plot elements as named arguments and then use what are called the
`element` family of functions to style them.

Let's start by regenerating the original scatter plot:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
p
```

To style text-based elements, such as axis labels as well as axis tick labels, we would use the `element_text` helper function:

```{r}
p +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14), 
        axis.text = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14, color = 'black'))
```

To style lines, such as axis lines, the `element_line` helper function is the way to go:

```{r}
p +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14), 
        axis.text = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14, color = 'black'),
        axis.line = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.75))
```

But this makes the grey background stick out more. We can get rid of an element altogether by setting it to `element_blank()`.

```{r}
p +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14), 
        axis.text = element_text(family = 'Helvetica', size = 14, color = 'black'),
        axis.line = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.75),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        legend.key = element_blank())
```

`ggplot2` also comes preloaded with a host of pre-made themes - try them out:

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
p + theme_classic()
```

### Faceting

`ggplot` has a special technique called *faceting* that allows the user to split
one plot into multiple subplots based on a variable included in the dataset. We
will use `facet_wrap` to make the same scatter plot as above (price by carat) but split it
by clarity:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ clarity) +
  theme_classic()
```

Alternatively, it may be useful to facet by two categorical variables. This is where `facet_grid` comes in:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(cut ~ clarity) +
  theme_classic()
```
