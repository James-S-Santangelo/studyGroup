## Preface: ##

This is an introduction to data analysis in Python, including data manipulation and
visualisation, and an introduction to common Python module in scientific computation.

We will be walking through the lesson content together using a
Jupyter notebook. We highly recommend installing [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Detailed
download instructions of all required software can be found [HERE](https://github.com/utm-coders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/install-git-python-r.md)


## Lesson Overview: ##

The lesson covers:

* Python class methods and attributes
* The Numpy module for scientific computation
* The Pandas module for dataframes
* The Matplotlib/Seaborn packages for visualisation

The [official Python documentation site](https://docs.python.org) goes into much more detail
regarding all topics covered in this code-along.  Python is supported
by a very, very extensive breadth of modules, a list can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
Please check out [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) for
 any question on it.
