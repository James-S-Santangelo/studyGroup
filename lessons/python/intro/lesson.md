## Preface: ##

This is a very basic introduction to the Python programming language,
based largely off of the tutorials in the [Beginners' Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers),
in particular the [Learn Python Tutorials](https://pythonspot.com/).

We will be walking through the lesson content together using a
Jupyter notebook. We highly recommend installing [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Detailed 
download instructions of all required software can be found [HERE](https://github.com/utm-coders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/install-git-python-r.md)


## Lesson Overview: ##

The lesson covers:

* Math, calculations with integers and floats
* Variables
* Lists, tuples and dicts
* Importing libraries
* Function declaration
* Conditionals (e.g., if-else) and for loops
* Brief Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn

The [official Python documentation site](https://docs.python.org) goes into much more detail
regarding all topics covered in this code-along.  Python is supported
by a very, very extensive breadth of packages, a list can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
Please check out [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) for
 any question on it.
