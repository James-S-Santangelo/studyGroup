This directory contains raw data that should **not** be used for analyses without processing. The data were collected by James S. Santangelo and record whether individual clover plants produce (1) or don't produce (0) cyanogenic plant defenses. There are data from approximately 16 cities, each with about 40 populations and 15 plants per population.

**If you had multiple datasets, you could descibe each of them here and also provide metadata for each (i.e., column descriptions)**
