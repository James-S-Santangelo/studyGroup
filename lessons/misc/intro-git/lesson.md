In this tutorial, we cover the basics of version control with Git and touch on using GitHub for collaboration.


**Preparation for this lesson**: To follow along with this lesson, you will
need to have `bash` installed. For Linux and OSX users, `bash` is included as
part of the operating system. In OSX, it can be accessed with `terminal`.

You will also need to have Git installed. For Windows users: We recommend
downloading `git bash`, which is packaged with [git](https://git-scm.com/) (a
common version control system).  This contains both Git and a a `bash`
terminal. To install Git on a Mac, you will need to install XCode from the Mac
App Store. Warning: XCode is a very large download, and one you'll likely want
to do well before the lesson!  Alternatively, if you have macOS 10.9
(Mavericks) or higher, simply open a Terminal instance and run

```
git --version
```

to commence the Git installation process. 

Finally, Linux users can install Git using `apt-get` at the command line:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

# Why version control?
